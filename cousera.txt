I am a student of AI and learning AI on my own through online free tutorials and courses. I am an unemployed person. My father is very old and cannot do anymore work.  So he cannot afford my fee. 
The main reason to applying scholarship for this course because I cannot afford your fee for this course.
The second reason is that free education is not very common in my country but, coursera is providing us the best opportunity of learning where I can get the latest skills and can change my life and make my parents proud. 
The teachers of coursera are great and very knowledgeable and teach with sincerity

As there is no platform that offers a financial aid but coursera is the only one who offers education free for needy people like me.

Hope you can understand and give me the opportunity to learn something unique on your platform

I will be very thankful if you accept my application

Thank you.



After taking this course,  I can enhance my knowledge about Tensorflow and Convolutional neural networks which is a big part of AI. 

As I am pursuing  career as an AI engineer and striving to get a handsome and high-paid job, this course will enhance my skills and chances of success in the interviews and getting a dream job. I am ambitious to do something different in my life and make my parents proud.




I cannot pay any loans now as I have no source of income yet. I am seeking free education, and need financial aid.
